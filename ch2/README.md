# Chapter 2 

## Exercises
2.1: : Add types, constants, and functions to tempconv for processing temperatures in the Kelvin scale, where zero Kelvin is −273.15°C and a difference of 1K has the same magnitude as 1°C.
2.2: Write a general-purpose unit-conversion program analogous to cf that reads numbers from its command-line arguments or from the standard input if there are no arguments, and converts each number into units like temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, length in feet and meters, weight in pounds and kilograms, and the like.
