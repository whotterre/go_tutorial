Exercise 4.1: Write a function that counts the number of bits that are different in two SHA256
hashes. (See PopCount from Section 2.6.2.)


Exercise 4.2: Write a program that prints the SHA256 hash of its standard input by default but
supports a command-line flag to print the SHA384 or SHA512 hash instead.
